# Python-Pandas

This repository contains code examples and exercises for learning data analysis using the Python Pandas library. The materials are aimed at learners who have some experience with Python and want to learn how to use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

## Getting Started

To use the materials in this repository, you should have Python 3 installed on your computer and be familiar with the basics of Python. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-pandas.git
```
Alternatively, you can download a ZIP archive of the repository and extract it to a local folder.

You will also need to install the Pandas library using pip:
```
pip install pandas
```

## Contents

The repository contains the following directories:

- `examples`: Code examples that demonstrate various Pandas concepts and features.
- `exercises`: Practice exercises for applying the concepts learned in the examples.
- `solutions`: Sample solutions for the exercises (provided for reference only).
- `data`: Sample datasets used in the examples and exercises.

## Usage

You can run the example scripts by executing the Python interpreter with the filename as an argument:
```
python examples/01_intro_to_pandas.py
```
You can run the exercises by editing the files in the `exercises` directory and running the corresponding test script in the `tests` directory:
```
python tests/test_intro_to_pandas.py
```
The tests will check if your code produces the expected output for each exercise.

## Contributing

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improving the materials, you can create an issue on the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/your-username/python-pandas/issues). You can also submit a pull request if you want to contribute code changes.

## Topics

This repository covers the following topics related to data analysis with Pandas:

- Introduction to Pandas (Series, DataFrame, Indexing, etc.)
- Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, etc.)
- Data visualization (plotting with Matplotlib)
- Time series analysis (resampling, rolling windows, etc.)
- Handling missing data (filling, dropping, imputing, etc.)
- Data aggregation and pivot tables
- Combining data from multiple sources (concatenation, merging, etc.)
- Advanced data transformation (apply, map, transform, etc.)
- Statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, etc.)

Each of these topics is explained in detail through code examples and exercises in the `examples` and `exercises` directories. The examples demonstrate how to use the various Pandas concepts and features, while the exercises provide hands-on practice for applying the concepts in different scenarios.

By completing the examples and exercises, you should gain a good understanding of the Pandas library and be able to use it for various data analysis tasks.
